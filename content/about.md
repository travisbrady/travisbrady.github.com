## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/travis_brady_li.jpeg" >}}

## Professional
I'm a Data Science and ML Engineering leader focused on building high-performing teams and high-quality learning systems that exist to move the needle.
I enjoy working on hard problems and love working with people that enjoy the same. For the last five years I've been at Expedia Group
focused on areas such as contextual bandits for UX optimization, search ranking, recommender systems, NLP and more.

Prior to my time with Expedia I have significant experience in SaaS, online games, online ads and
economic consulting where I was lucky to get to work among a group of very talented folks.

In addition to my focus areas at work I enjoy creating efficient and explicitly *small* systems that run quickly and require little electricity.
I also have a long-running interest in sketching and streaming algorithms evidenced by my [flajolet](https://github.com/travisbrady/flajolet) library. The library is named for [Philippe Flajolet](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/) inventor of the Hyperloglog data structure.

## Personal
I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia and have since lived in Austin, San Francisco, DC and San Diego. I'm a huge fan of
exploring cities, cycling, neapolitan pizza, functional programming, baking (mediocre) bread and I love the novels of Charles Portis.

# Open Source Software
My open source code is all visible on my Github page but I collect a few highlights here along with their goals.
1. [ocaml-vw](https://github.com/travisbrady/ocaml-vw) OCaml bindings to the [Vowpal Wabbit](https://vowpalwabbit.org/) machine learning system
2. [word2phrase.py](https://github.com/travisbrady/word2phrase) Python port of T. Mikolov's word2phrase algorithm
3. [ccard](https://github.com/travisbrady/ccard) Fast command line utility for the approximate counting of strings. Uses the Loglog-Beta algorithm for distinct values estimation component and Metrohash for hashing. Helpful if you work with lots of text data at the command line
4. [flajolet](https://github.com/travisbrady/flajolet) OCaml library providing approximate/sketching data structures for things such as distinct values estimation (hyperloglog), approximate set membership (bloom filters), frequency estimation (count min sketch), top-k queries (aka approximate frequency tables)
5. [ocaml-h3](https://github.com/travisbrady/ocaml-h3) OCaml bindings to Uber's [H3](https://h3geo.org/) hierarchical spatial indexing system

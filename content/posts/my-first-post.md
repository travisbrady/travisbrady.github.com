First post. Mostly just testing for now but thought I'd describe a few areas I plan to focus on if I'm actually able to continue writing here.

- Simplicity in machine learning
- Ways you can shoot yourself in the foot with machine learning
- Quick Surveys of sub-fields within Data Science and Machine Learning
- Evaluations of software options for certain specific ML applications
- Reviews of cookies: I'm not kidding I plan to review cookies
- I'll probably also review pizza as well while I'm at it
- Writeups on my cycling training and my dreams of owning a [BMC Roadmachine One](https://us-en.bmc-switzerland.com/roadmachine-one.html)
- Coffee: I am far from an expert but I love experimenting
